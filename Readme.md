# 🍽️ QuickBite Express – Business Recovery Dashboard  
**A Codebasics Power BI Resume Project Challenge**  
📊 *Analyzing business recovery and customer trust for a food delivery platform after a crisis.*

---

## 📘 Project Overview
QuickBite Express, a food delivery startup, faced a major drop in orders, customer satisfaction, and delivery performance during a crisis period.  
This project uses **data analytics and visualization** to uncover the key causes of decline and recommend **data-driven recovery strategies**.

The project was built as part of the [Codebasics Power BI Resume Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/), where participants create end-to-end analytical solutions using real-world business cases.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The analysis focuses on six key questions:
1. 🧍‍♂️ **Customer Segments:** Which customers can be recovered, and which require new strategies?  
2. 🛒 **Order Patterns:** How did order behavior change across *Pre-Crisis*, *Crisis*, and *Recovery* phases?  
3. 🚴 **Delivery Performance:** What were the SLA compliance gaps and delivery delays?  
4. 🎯 **Campaign Opportunities:** How can targeted campaigns rebuild trust and loyalty?  
5. 🍴 **Restaurant Partnerships:** Which partners drive long-term value retention?  
6. 💬 **Feedback & Sentiment:** How did ratings and reviews evolve during the crisis?

## 🧱 Data Journey

### 🔹 1. Data Sources
- 8 CSV files (4 fact + 4 dimension tables):



### 🔹 2. Staging (MySQL)
- All files loaded as `VARCHAR` into staging tables (`stg_*`).
- Performed sanity checks:
- ✅ Primary/Foreign key integrity  
- ✅ Date and numeric format validation  
- ✅ Logical reconciliation (`subtotal - discount + delivery_fee = total`)

### 🔹 3. Cleaning & Transformation
- Fixed inconsistent `acquisition_channel` values.  
- Removed invalid `customer_id` and `order_id` records.  
- Derived columns:
- `order_month`
- `sla_diff`
- `phase` (*Pre-Crisis*, *Crisis*, *Recovery*)
- Ensured consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD).

### 🔹 4. Modeling
- Snowflake schema with **fact_orders** at center.
- Relationships:
- `fact_orders` ↔ `dim_customer`
- `fact_orders` ↔ `dim_restaurant`
- `fact_orders` ↔ `fact_ratings`
- `fact_orders` ↔ `fact_delivery_performance`
- Created calculated measures:
- `Total Revenue`
- `Avg Rating`
- `SLA Miss %`
- `Order Drop %`
- `Customer Churn %`

### 🔹 5. Visualization (Power BI)
- Built 5 interconnected pages:
1. **Executive Summary**
2. **High-Value Customers**
3. **Restaurant Partnerships**
4. **Misconception & Assumptions**
- Custom theme (`QuickBite Theme.json`) using brand colors (#4E79A7, #F28E2B, #59A14F).
- Added interactive slicers (Phase, Month, City).

## 🧠 Key Insights
- 📉 Orders dropped **70%** during the crisis period.  
- 🕒 SLA breaches increased by **55%**, directly impacting customer ratings.  
- ⭐ Top 5% high-value customers saw largest rating decline.  
- 🏙️ Tier-1 cities like **Bengaluru** and **Mumbai** faced sharpest drop in order volume.  
- 💬 Sentiment analysis revealed keywords: *“late”, “cold”, “cancelled”* – indicating delivery reliability issues.
